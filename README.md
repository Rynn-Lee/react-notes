# üõ†Ô∏è How to run
To clone the repository, use<br>
```git clone https://github.com/Rynn-Lee/react-notes```<br><br>
To run the app, use - ```yarn start``` inside the "react-notes" folder<br>
The app uses localStorage to store all your notes, so you don't need to run any server

# üìå The future of this project
i'm going to add many features and use it as fully comprehensive app<br>
Also, i'm planning to create this app for Android phones using React Native
